# Graph-CV-Base

## About

This is an experimental project to test graph databases, information retrieval and application structure. The project concerns analyzing data in work applications curricula. The features planned are: uploading and deleting curricula files, retrieving data from the files, fitting the data into a graph database, accessing the database, displaying the data in a user interface. The pipeline should be visualized at the end.

Technologies used: Python, (graph DB), LLMs, FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, GitHub Projects, GitHub Copilot.

Assumptions:
- The project is managed in GitHub Projects: [here](https://github.com/users/azawadzka/projects/4).
- The project uses microservices architecture in a monorepo for learning purposes.
- Each stage should be developed on a separate branch (define stage).
- Unit tests assured.
